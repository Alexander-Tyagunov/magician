## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- README.md: added missing `/magic` skill to the skills table
- README.md: updated version badge from 1.0.0 to 1.1.1

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- `/magic` skill — structured research, analysis, and consulting with AskUserQuestion-driven gates
  - Web search via WebSearch tool
  - Library documentation search via context7 MCP (auto-detects if missing, offers install)
  - Local document analysis (financial reports, PDFs, text files)
  - Multi-phase workflow: scope → sources → research → output format → persistence
  - Every decision gate uses AskUserQuestion for explicit action-reaction UI
  - Clear separation between Tech Library Docs (context7, for software/framework questions only)
    and Document/File analysis (Read tool, for Excel/PDF/reports/articles — no MCP needed)
  - context7 guarded by topic classification: only invoked for genuine software library questions
  - Academic/scientific research support: targets Google Scholar, arXiv, PubMed, IEEE, ACM;
    citation-aware output formats (literature review, annotated bibliography, research outline);
    citation style selection (APA, MLA, IEEE, Harvard, Chicago); academic Phase 5 navigation
  - Context-aware skill navigation (Phase 5): after delivering findings, intelligently proposes
    relevant next magician skills (/conjure, /blueprint, /unravel, /sentinel, /accelerate)
    based on research type — with a warm graceful exit when the user is done
  - Auto-invokes /conjure when visual output is requested
  - Save and git-commit output from within the skill
- Keyword auto-invoke via `pattern-detect.sh` — triggers /magic on research-intent terms:
  research, investigate, analyze, explore, examine, assess, evaluate, discover, audit, study, and more

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- Plugin manifest and marketplace catalog for one-command installation

- 4 specialist agents: reviewer, simplifier, verifier, sentinel
- Full hook system: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse,

- Pattern recognition — tracks repeated prompts, offers skill creation at threshold
- Self-learning via chronicle — session summaries persist across plugin updates
- Team workspace — .workspace/shared/ committed, .workspace/local/ always gitignored
- Security as infrastructure — hard deny rules in settings.json + PreToolUse guard
- Wizard cat ASCII art on every session start
